## What is The Shift About?
 
The Shift is a film that explores the concept of shifting from ambition to meaning. According to Dr. Wayne Dyer, ambition is the drive to achieve goals and acquire things that are external to us, such as money, fame, or power. Meaning, on the other hand, is the drive to connect with our true essence and purpose, which are internal to us, such as love, joy, or peace.
 
Dr. Wayne Dyer argues that ambition is not inherently bad, but it can become a trap if we let it define our identity and happiness. He suggests that we can make a shift from ambition to meaning by following four principles:
 
- The first principle is to be open to everything and attached to nothing. This means that we should be flexible and adaptable to the changes and challenges that life brings us, without clinging to our ego or expectations.
- The second principle is to live from a place of no ego. This means that we should let go of our false self, which is the image that we project to the world based on our achievements and possessions. Instead, we should embrace our true self, which is the divine spark that resides within us.
- The third principle is to live in radical humility. This means that we should recognize that we are not separate from or superior to anyone or anything in the universe. We should acknowledge that we are all connected and interdependent, and that we are all expressions of the same source.
- The fourth principle is to live in service and gratitude. This means that we should use our gifts and talents to serve others and make a positive difference in the world. We should also appreciate the abundance and beauty that surrounds us and express our gratitude for all that we have and are.

    By following these principles, Dr. Wayne Dyer claims that we can make a shift from ambition to meaning and experience a more fulfilling and authentic life.
