## How to Play as Korea in Shogun 2?
 
To play as Korea in Shogun 2 with the Morning Sun mod, you need to start a new campaign and select the Kingdom of Joseon as your faction.

Your allies are the Ming Empire and the other Korean clans: Gyeonggi, Chungcheong and Hamgyeong.
 
Your faction leader is King Seonjo, who fled to Pyongyang after Hideyoshi's invasion. Your faction heir is Prince Gwanghae, who stayed in Seoul to resist the Japanese. Your faction specialty is Confucianism, which gives you bonuses to research rate and public order. Your faction weakness is isolationism, which reduces your trade income and diplomatic relations.
