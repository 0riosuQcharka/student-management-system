If you want to enjoy Strike Suit Zero to the fullest, you might want to follow some gameplay tips that can help you improve your skills and performance. Here are some of them:
 
- Use your brakes wisely. Braking can help you turn faster and avoid enemy fire, but it also makes you an easy target. Don't brake for too long or too often, and try to vary your speed and direction.
- Use your Strike Mode strategically. The Strike Suit can transform into a mecha mode that gives you more firepower and maneuverability, but it also consumes energy. You can replenish energy by destroying enemies or collecting energy pods. Use Strike Mode when you need to deal a lot of damage or evade a tough situation, but don't waste it on weak enemies or empty space.
- Choose your weapons carefully. You can equip different weapons on your craft, such as lasers, missiles, torpedoes, and plasma cannons. Each weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages, such as range, damage, reload time, and ammo capacity. Experiment with different combinations and find out what works best for you.
- Target the weak points of capital ships. Capital ships are huge and heavily armed, but they also have weak points that you can exploit. Look for glowing red spots on their hulls, such as turrets, engines, bridges, or reactors. Hitting these spots will deal more damage and cause chain reactions that can cripple or destroy the ship.
- Watch your radar and HUD. Your radar and HUD can provide you with useful information, such as enemy positions, objectives, waypoints, health bars, and energy levels. Pay attention to them and use them to plan your actions and tactics.

Strike Suit Zero is a game that rewards skill and strategy. If you follow these tips, you will have a better chance of surviving and succeeding in your missions. Have fun and good luck!
