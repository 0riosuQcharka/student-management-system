Built-in Mode uses the program's own uninstaller to remove it from your PC. This is the fastest and simplest mode, but it may not be able to delete all the leftovers that the program may leave behind.
 
Safe Mode is similar to Built-in Mode, but it also performs a quick scan of your registry and hard drive to find and delete any traces that the program's uninstaller may have missed.
 
Normal Mode is more thorough than Safe Mode, as it performs a deeper scan of your system and removes more leftovers that may be hidden in various locations.
 
Super Mode is the most comprehensive and powerful mode of uninstallation, as it uses a special algorithm to analyze and delete all the components that are associated with the program. This mode may take longer than the others, but it ensures that no trace of the program remains on your PC.
