## Classification of Signals
  
Signals are functions that represent physical phenomena or information. They can be classified according to different criteria, such as:

- Continuous-time or discrete-time: A continuous-time signal is defined for all values of time, while a discrete-time signal is defined only for discrete values of time.
- Periodic or aperiodic: A periodic signal repeats itself after a fixed interval of time, while an aperiodic signal does not.
- Even or odd: An even signal is symmetric about the origin, while an odd signal is antisymmetric about the origin.
- Deterministic or random: A deterministic signal can be predicted exactly, while a random signal cannot.
- Energy or power: An energy signal has finite energy and zero average power, while a power signal has infinite energy and finite average power.

## Convolution and Correlation of Signals
  
Convolution and correlation are two important operations that are used to analyze the relationship between two signals. Convolution is used to find the output of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system when the input is given, while correlation is used to measure the similarity or dissimilarity between two signals.
  
The convolution of two continuous-time signals x(t) and h(t) is defined as:
  $$y(t) = x(t) \* h(t) = \int\_-\infty^\infty x(\tau) h(t - \tau) d\tau$$  
The convolution of two discrete-time signals x(n) and h(n) is defined as:
  $$y(n) = x(n) \* h(n) = \sum\_k=-\infty^\infty x(k) h(n - k)$$  
The correlation of two continuous-time signals x(t) and y(t) is defined as:
  $$R\_xy(t) = \int\_-\infty^\infty x(\tau) y(\tau + t) d\tau$$  
The correlation of two discrete-time signals x(n) and y(n) is defined as:
  $$R\_xy(n) = \sum\_k=-\infty^\infty x(k) y(k + n)$$  
## Continuous-Time Fourier Series (CTFS)
  
A continuous-time periodic signal can be represented as a sum of sinusoids with frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. This representation is called the continuous-time Fourier series (CTFS). The CTFS coefficients are given by:
  $$c\_k = \frac1T \int\_-T/2^T/2 x(t) e^-j 2 \pi k f\_0 t dt$$  
where T is the period, f\_0 = 1/T is the fundamental frequency, and k is an integer. The CTFS synthesis equation is given by:
  $$x(t) = \sum\_k=-\infty^\infty c\_k e^j 2 \pi k f\_0 t$$ 8cf37b1e13
