1. First, you will need to find a torrent file that contains the Igo Primo 24 software and the maps for your region. You can search for such files on various torrent websites, such as [GPS Power](https://www.gpspower.net/igo-primo-nextgen-software/363335-igo-nextgen-v9-35-2-252374-24-feb-2021-world-armv8a-aarch64.html) or [MHH Auto](https://mhhauto.com/Thread-New-Maps-iGO-HERE-Europe-2022-Q2-torrent). Make sure the file is compatible with your device's processor architecture (armv8a/aarch64 or arm32) and has positive feedback from other users.
2. Next, you will need to download a torrent client app on your device, such as [uTorrent](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.utorrent.client) or [Transdroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.transdroid.lite). These apps will allow you to open and download the torrent file.
3. After you have downloaded the torrent client app, open it and locate the torrent file that you downloaded in step 1. Tap on it and select a folder where you want to save the downloaded files. Wait for the download to complete.
4. Once the download is finished, you will need to extract the files from the compressed archive. You can use an app like [ZArchiver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver) or [RAR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rarlab.rar) for this purpose. Open the app and navigate to the folder where you saved the downloaded files. Tap on the archive file and choose "Extract here" or "Extract to..." option.
5. After you have extracted the files, you will see a folder named "Android" that contains the Igo Primo 24 software and the maps. Copy this folder to your device's internal storage or SD card.
6. Finally, you will need to install the Igo Primo 24 APK file that is located in the "Android/data/com.nng.igo.primong.igoworld/files" folder. Tap on it and follow the instructions on the screen. You may need to enable "Unknown sources" option in your device's settings to allow the installation of apps from outside the Google Play Store.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Igo Primo 24 on your Android device. You can now launch it from your app drawer and enjoy its features.
